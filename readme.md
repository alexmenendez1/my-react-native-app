I used Copilot to create a chart for my app, which saved me a lot of time since I wouldn’t have known where to start building a chart from scratch. While working on the project, I initially placed my imports at the bottom of the file. Copilot was assisting me, but I later realized that imports need to be at the top. I rejected Copilot’s suggestion because I was putting the code in the wrong spot. Copilot is a helpful tool, but if I don’t know where certain code belongs, following its suggestions can lead to errors.
